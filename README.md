# banglore_house_price_prediction
The Bangalore House Price Prediction project is a data-driven initiative aimed at estimating the prices of residential properties in Bangalore based on various influencing factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project analyzes features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, amenities, and proximity to key landmarks to predict housing prices with high accuracy.

The project involves:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw housing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and optimizing key factors that influence house prices.
Model Development: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to build a predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Testing the model's performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Deployment: Creating an interactive tool or API for users to input parameters and get price predictions.
